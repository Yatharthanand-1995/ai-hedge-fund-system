## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- **Log Rotation**: Implemented rotating file handler for API logs (10MB max, 5 backups)
- **Scripts Organization**: Created `scripts/` directory structure with subdirectories for analysis, backtesting, monitoring, and verification
- **scripts/README.md**: Comprehensive documentation for all utility scripts
- **docs/PRODUCTION_CONFIG.md**: Production configuration documentation (renamed from RECOMMENDED_CONFIG_APPLIED.md)
- **docs/DATA_LIMITATIONS.md**: Data limitations and look-ahead bias documentation

### Fixed
- **Critical TypeError**: Fixed `Series.__format__` error in backtest result output (affected 3 scripts)
- **Log Management**: Organized and archived 28MB of log files, preventing disk space issues

### Changed
- **Project Structure**: Reorganized 11 scripts into logical subdirectories
- **Log Storage**: All logs now stored in `logs/` with subdirectories (api, backtests, tests, archive)
- **Configuration**: Static agent weights (F:40% M:30% Q:20% S:10%) confirmed optimal, adaptive weights disabled by default

### Removed
- **Experimental Files**: Cleaned up 18 experimental test scripts and status documents from root directory
- **Failed Tier 1 Experiments**: Removed Tier 1 improvement attempt files (volatility buffer approach failed with -10.5pp performance)
- **Duplicate Test Logs**: Compressed and archived 8 old test log files

### Performance
- **Baseline Validated**: 162-173% return over 5 years (2020-2025)
- **CAGR**: 17-19% annualized
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.75-0.85
- **vs SPY**: +50-60pp outperformance

### Deprecated

## Lessons Learned

### Tier 1 Failure (October 2025)
**Attempt**: Hybrid stop-loss + volatility buffer + quality tracking
**Result**: **FAILED** - 144.29% return vs 154.82% baseline (-10.5pp worse)
**Root Cause**: Volatility buffer (20% wider stops for high-vol stocks) prevented timely exits
**Lesson**: Wider stops don't reduce false positives; they increase late stops. Original stops were correct.

### Adaptive Weights Testing (October 2025)
**Finding**: Static weights (40/30/20/10) outperformed adaptive weights by 5-21pp
**Configuration Tested**: 4 combinations over 2020-2025
**Winner**: Baseline static weights - 172.82% return
**Lesson**: Market regime adaptation sounds good in theory but degrades real performance. Stick with proven weights.

## Future Roadmap

### Under Consideration
- **Weekly Position Monitoring**: Check positions weekly (not quarterly) for early deterioration detection
  - Expected impact: +4-5pp improvement
  - Risk: 4x API calls (rate limiting concerns)

- **Enhanced Sentiment Analysis**: Real-time news and social media sentiment
- **Multi-Portfolio Support**: User-defined custom portfolios
- **Options Analysis**: Options-based hedging strategies

### Not Planned
- ~~Adaptive agent weights~~ (tested, reduced performance)
- ~~Volatility-based stop adjustments~~ (tested, increased late stops)
