---

## ⚠️ SYSTEM LIMITATIONS

### Struggles in Bear Markets
- Lost -2.52% when SPY gained +6.79% (2021-2022)
- Growth-focused strategy vulnerable in downturns
- Higher volatility in uncertain markets

### Look-Ahead Bias Concerns
- Fundamentals agent (5% weight) uses current data
- Sentiment agent (5% weight) uses current sentiment
- Mitigated by low weights in backtest mode

### Limited Diversification
- 10-stock universe may be concentrated
- Tech-heavy bias (6 tech stocks)
- Sector rotation not optimal

---

## 🤖 4-AGENT SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

### Agent Weights (Backtest Mode)
- **Momentum: 50%** - Most reliable for historical analysis
- **Quality: 40%** - Stable business metrics
- **Fundamentals: 5%** - Has look-ahead bias, reduced weight
- **Sentiment: 5%** - Has look-ahead bias, reduced weight

### Why These Weights?
1. **Momentum** is pure technical analysis - no look-ahead
2. **Quality** uses business fundamentals available historically
3. **Fundamentals** reduced due to potential future data leakage
4. **Sentiment** reduced due to current market sentiment bias

### Agent Performance Evidence
Real agent scores logged during backtests:

```
✅ AAPL: Composite score = 60.4 (F:62 M:44 Q:82 S:51, Conf:0.87)
✅ MSFT: Composite score = 49.5 (F:69 M:24 Q:78 S:56, Conf:0.92)
✅ GOOGL: Composite score = 48.7 (F:73 M:21 Q:80 S:51, Conf:0.92)
✅ NVDA: Composite score = 50.7 (F:70 M:42 Q:70 S:56, Conf:0.92)
